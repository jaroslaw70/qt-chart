Building
========

Configure project with qmake and build project with make:
    (Linux) make 
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Visual Studio) nmake
    (OSX) make

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug ; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make debug
    
For release builds:    
    qmake CONFIG+=release ; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make release
    
For both builds
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make all    


If you want to install the libraries to your Qt library directory use:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the libraries
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies you will just have to add staticlib to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=staticlib

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found from doc/html directory.

The documentation can also be generated with "make docs".

KNOWN ISSUES
============
* Logartmic, polar axis are not supported at the moment.
* Automatic scaling of the axes is only done when you add a series on a chart
* API for Animations state (signaling started, finished) and setting duration
  etc. is missing
* Layout in QBarCategoriesAxis can cause categories to overlap
* Only one Y and X axis can be visible at the same time
* Unit label for axes is not implemented
* In some cases (e.g. long texts) can cause some issues with layout
* When setting new QBarCategoriesAxis to existing chart, axis doesn't initialise properly

Main Changes between Beta and Final
===================================
* QML examples and documentation has been added
* Axis implementation has been refactored in order to support more flexible axis schemes in future. 
* Setting Multiple axes is now possible and you can select which one is visible.
* In future it's possible to display several axes at the same time.
* QBarCategoriesAxis and QValuesAxis classes have been added.
* QBarSeries change to QGroupedBarSeries introduced in Beta has been reverted.
* "Getting Started" documentation has been added.
* Chart layout management has been refactored.
