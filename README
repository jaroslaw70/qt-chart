KNOWN ISSUES
============
* The beta version of Qt Commercial Charts is still under development and thus should not be used in e.g. product development
* The Charts API might change between the Beta and the first official release
* Mutliple axis are not suported at the moment.
* Logartmic, polar axis are not supported at the moment.
* If using QAbstractiItemModel derived model with QBarSeries, data manipulation with QBarSeries/QBarSet APIs does not synchronize the data into the model
* Model support requires more thorough testing.
* Some QObject properties are missing
* Some notifications missing from QObject properties
* Legend layout does not work correctly with several labels
* Animations with Bar Charts can cause crashes in certain situations
* Automatic scaling of the axes is only done when you add a series on a chart
* The QML Bindings are still under development
* Mouse and touch interactions not complete on the QML API
* Missing documentation for QML API; the QML demo applications serve as documentation instead
* Setting bar width is not possible on QBarSeries derived classes (the width is affected with setMargin, but it has limitations)
* API for Animations state (signaling started , finished) and setting&nbsp;duration etc. are missing

Main changes between Technology Preview and Beta releases
=========================================================
* QBarSeries now enables defining both values and bar placement in X-Axis. Previous implementation of QBarSeries is now new series type: QGroupedBarSeries
* QML API now defined and mostly implemented
* Q_PROPERTY definitions have been added to the API
* Model API&nbsp; refactored and moved from Series Classes to separate Model Mapper Classes
* First version of Qt Designer plugin included
* Example for handling Gestures included (ZoomLineChart example)
