Building
========

Please note that if you have already installed a previous version of
Qt Charts, you should first uninstall it with
    make uninstall

Configure project with qmake and build project with make:
    (Linux) make 
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Visual Studio) nmake
    (OSX) make

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make debug
    
For release builds:    
    qmake CONFIG+=release; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make release
    
For both builds:
    qmake CONFIG+="debug_and_release build_all"; make

If you want to leave out demos and examples from the build you can use
the following config with qmake:
    CONFIG+=nomake_demos_examples

If you want to install the libraries to your Qt library directory use:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the libraries:
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies, you will just have to add staticlib to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=staticlib

Documentation
=============

Documentation can be found from doc/html and doc/qch directories. The documentation
can also be generated with:
    make docs

The documentation provided with Charts is generated with qdoc and the creation of the
documentation is prioritized for Qt5. We recommend building the documentation using Qt5,
if you want to do it yourself. Creating the documentation using Qt4 also works, but some
pages are not generated correctly, such as the 'List of All Members' page for all C++ and
QML APIs in .qch documentation.

Main Changes between 1.3.0 and 1.3.1
====================================

- New Qt theme template added
