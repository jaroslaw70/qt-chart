Building
========
Please note that if you have already installed a previous version of
Qt Charts, you should first uninstall it with
    make uninstall

Configure project with qmake and build project with make:
    (Linux) make 
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Visual Studio) nmake
    (OSX) make

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make debug
    
For release builds:    
    qmake CONFIG+=release ; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make release
    
For both builds
    qmake CONFIG+="debug_and_release build_all"; make

If you want to leave out demos and examples from the build you can use
the following config with qmake:
    CONFIG+=nomake_demos_examples

If you want to install the libraries to your Qt library directory use:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the libraries
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies you will just have to add staticlib to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=staticlib

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found from doc/html and doc/qch directories. The documentation
can also be generated with:
    make docs

Main Changes between 1.2.1 and 1.3.0
====================================

- New chart type added: Polar chart
- New series type added: Box and whiskers
- QtQuick 2 support added
  - Note: Since Qt Charts still uses QGraphicsView framework under the hood
    even with QtQuick 2, its performance is actually better with QtQuick 1 than with QtQuick 2.

Bug Fixes and minor new features
================================

- New: Added missing QML support for LogValueAxis
- New: Implement index based removing/replacing points in a series
- New: Added API to specify plot area background for the chart
- New: Added HTML support for various text items such as axis labels or titles
       - HTML tags (e.g. <br/>) and character codes (e.g. &deg;) are now supported
       - Setting pen for text items is deprecated and does nothing
       - When setting brush for text items, only the color of the brush is relevant.
         It specifies the default text color for the item.
       - Logic for identifying axis label format specifiers was improved, so adding
         additional information to labels via label format string is now more viable.
- New: Added QChart::zoomReset() and QChart::isZoomed()
- New: Added API for setting roundness of the corners for the background of the chart
- Fixed: If vertical QLogValueAxis base is selected so that it has only single visible tick,
         its label always displays as "..."
- Fixed: Crash when removing pie series from chart
- Fixed: Most themes disable axis shades
- Fixed: Lingering shades from high contrast theme
- Fixed: Crash when adding/removing points during animation
- Fixed: Wrong expand direction with rotated chart view
- Fixed: Android build errors
- Fixed: Explicitly set default pen/brush/font got overridden by theme
         - Default pens, brushes, and fonts were changed to ones that won't clash with commonly
           used types of the same. Most notably black pen is no longer default and won't anymore
           get overridden by theme if used.
- Fixed: Multi-line axis titles and labels now position correctly
         - Note that '\n' no longer causes new line in text items, use HTML tag <br/> instead
- Fixed: Legend markers text truncation with small font sizes
- Fixed: QChartView right click zoom out when zooming only along one axis
- Fixed: Crash or memory leak when resetting animation options mid-animation
- Fixed: QBarCategoryAxis doesn't notify domain on category remove
- Fixed: axisXTop QML property now actually puts axis on top
