Building
========
Please note that if you have already installed a previous version of
QtCommercial Charts, you should first uninstall it with
    make uninstall

Configure project with qmake and build project with make:
    (Linux) make 
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Visual Studio) nmake
    (OSX) make

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make debug
    
For release builds:    
    qmake CONFIG+=release ; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make release
    
For both builds
    qmake CONFIG+="debug_and_release build_all"; make

If you want to install the libraries to your Qt library directory use:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the libraries
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies you will just have to add staticlib to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=staticlib

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found from doc/html and doc/qch directories. The documentation
can also be generated with:
