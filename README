Building
========
Please note that if you have already installed a previous version of
QtCommercial Charts, you should first uninstall it with
    make uninstall

Configure project with qmake and build project with make:
    (Linux) make 
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Visual Studio) nmake
    (OSX) make

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make debug
    
For release builds:    
    qmake CONFIG+=release ; make
    or 
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release; make release
    
For both builds
    qmake CONFIG+="debug_and_release build_all"; make

If you want to install the libraries to your Qt library directory use:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the libraries
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies you will just have to add staticlib to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=staticlib

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found from doc/html and doc/qch directories. The documentation
can also be generated with:
    make docs

Main Changes between 1.2.0 and 1.2.1
===================================

- Commercial Charts documentation also as *.qch file

Bug Fixes
==========
- Fixed: Crash with NaN, inf, -inf values (values are ignored)
- Fixed: Axis label truncated with multiple axis
- Fixed: Using setLineVisible(false) on a QBarCategoryAxis gives blurry text
- Fixed: Set the range to min and max for default axes from previously added series
- Fixed: Axes use incorrect bounding rectangle to calculate sizeHint when labels are in non-default angle
- Fixed: Axis titles can slightly overlap with axis labels and axis lines
- Fixed: Charts crashes when changing the values to empty model with logarithmic axis
- Fixed: The legend marker for main series in breakdown series piechart couldnt be updated with custom value
- Fixed: Positioning errors with category axis and bar category axis ticks

Known Issues
============
- Automatic scaling of the axes is only done when you add a series on a chart
- DateTimeAxis is not supported on ARM because of floating point precision
  issues (qreals are floats)
- Declarative plugin is available from Qt 4.7.4 onwards because of missing
  Q_REVISION macro in the earlier Qt releases
- Defining axis min-max values sometimes affects other axes with the same orientation
  - See for example the secondary y-axis of QML Weather demo application
  - The work-around is to set axis range dynamically instead of initializing min and
    max properties to certain values
