    * Some areas will be refactored before the first official release
    * Qt Designer plugin is missing

- QML API
    * The QML Bindings are still under development and to be considered as early preview
    * Windows: You need to copy qmldir file to the qmlplugin installation folder; it is
      not copied during build
