\brief The LogValueAxis element is used for manipulating chart's axes.
\inherits AbstractAxis

\note If a LogValueAxis is attached to a series with one or more points with
negative or zero values on the associated dimension, the series will not be
plotted at all. This is particularly relevant when XYModelMappers are used,
since empty cells in models typically contain zero values.
