     The example shows how to create simple scatter chart.

    To create scatter charts, QScatterSeries instance is needed. Here we create scatter series instance and we set the type, color and width of outline for scatter points.

    \snippet ../examples/scatterchart/main.cpp 1

    We add data to be shown. We can use add() member function or use stream operator.  

    \snippet ../examples/scatterchart/main.cpp 2

    In the end we create QChartView instance, set title, set anti-aliasing and add scatter series. 

    \snippet ../examples/scatterchart/main.cpp 3
    
    Chart is ready to be shown.
