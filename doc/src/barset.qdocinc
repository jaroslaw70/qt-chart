BarSet represents one set of bars. Set of bars contains one data value for each category.
First value of set is assumed to belong to first category, second to second category and so on.
If set has fewer values than there are categories, then the missing values are assumed to be
at the end of set. For missing values in middle of a set, numerical value of zero is used.
