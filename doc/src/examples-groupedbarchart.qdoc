    \title GroupedBarChart Example
    \subtitle

    The example shows how to create simple bar chart. GroupedBarChart shows the data in sets as separate bars, which are grouped in categories.

    First we define categories.

    \snippet ../examples/groupedbarchart/main.cpp 1

    Data that groupedbarchart visualizes, is defined by QBarSet instances. Here we create some sets and append data
    we want to visualize to them.

    \snippet ../examples/groupedbarchart/main.cpp 2

    To combine the sets and categories to a chart, we need to create QBarSeries instance. When creating
	the QBarSeries, the categories must be known. Sets can be added later. For example purposes the sets
	are added to series here.

    Then we create a chart and add the series to it.

    And we also want to show the legend, so that the data is easier to read.

    \snippet ../examples/groupedbarchart/main.cpp 5

    Finally we add the chart onto a view.

    \snippet ../examples/groupedbarchart/main.cpp 6

    And it is ready to be shown in a window.
