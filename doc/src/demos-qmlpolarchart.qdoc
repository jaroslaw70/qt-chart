    This is a demonstration of how to use polar chart in your QML application.

    \table
        \row
            \o  \br
                We begin with a chart that has a spline series and a scatter series with random
                data. Both series use the same axes.

        \row
            \o  \br
                The next example shows a chart with some accurate historical data that makes us to use a DateTimeAxis
                and AreaSeries.

        \row
            \o  \br
                And the final example with a chart that uses a CategoryAxis to make the data easier to understand.
